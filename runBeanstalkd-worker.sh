# a shell script that keeps looping until an exit code is given
# if it does an exit(0), restart after a second - or if it's a declared error
# if we've restarted in a planned fashion, we don't bother with any pause
# and for one particular code, exit the script entirely.
# The numbers 97, 98, 99 must match what is returned from the PHP script

## Possibilities
# 97    - planned pause/restart
# 98    - planned restart
# 99    - planned stop, exit.
# 0     - unplanned restart (as returned by "exit;")
#        - Anything else is also unplanned paused/restart

if [ $ERR -eq 97 ]
then
   # a planned pause, then restart

if [ $ERR -eq 98 ]
then
   # a planned restart - instantly

fi

if [ $ERR -eq 99 ]
then
   # planned complete exit
   echo "99: PLANNED_SHUTDOWN";

# unplanned exit, pause, and restart
